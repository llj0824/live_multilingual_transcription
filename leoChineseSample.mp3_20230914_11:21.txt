[0.00s -> 11.00s]  Today is September 5th, maybe the 6th day in Feidang.
[11.00s -> 18.00s]  I started to feel a bit uncomfortable yesterday.
[18.00s -> 26.00s]  And then I felt that when I woke up, I would be very...
[26.00s -> 33.00s]  Very likely that my body would be very...
[33.00s -> 38.00s]  Well, when I woke up, I felt...
[38.00s -> 42.00s]  I felt that maybe it was flu.
[42.00s -> 47.00s]  I think it's very likely that I got...
[47.00s -> 52.00s]  Covid.
[52.00s -> 56.00s]  And then I...
[56.00s -> 59.00s]  I went to work again today.
[59.00s -> 64.00s]  I also went to eat breakfast because my body was not feeling well.
[64.00s -> 68.00s]  I went to bed early and woke up early.
[68.00s -> 70.00s]  The breakfast was quite good.
[70.00s -> 76.00s]  My body was feeling much better.
[77.00s -> 81.00s]  And then I went to class.
[81.00s -> 85.00s]  I was reading the accounting.
[85.00s -> 87.00s]  Let me check the accounting.
[87.00s -> 97.00s]  What is it called?
[97.00s -> 102.00s]  The accounting.
[102.00s -> 108.00s]  Personally, I am quite interested in this class.
[108.00s -> 113.00s]  I think it's quite useful.
[113.00s -> 119.00s]  To understand what a 10K class is.
[119.00s -> 121.00s]  I went to class.
[121.00s -> 124.00s]  I had a class with a classmate.
[124.00s -> 126.00s]  It's called QI.
[126.00s -> 128.00s]  QI Tian.
[128.00s -> 141.00s]  Let me check.
[141.00s -> 144.00s]  Where is he?
[144.00s -> 147.00s]  I forgot.
[147.00s -> 150.00s]  Where is he?
[150.00s -> 155.00s]  He is not here.
[155.00s -> 157.00s]  Tian Qi.
[157.00s -> 161.00s]  Yang Tian Qi.
[161.00s -> 164.00s]  I had lunch with him.
[164.00s -> 166.00s]  It's quite interesting.
[166.00s -> 171.00s]  To listen to him talk about his situation with China.
[171.00s -> 178.00s]  He went to work in the government.
[178.00s -> 185.00s]  He took the public exam.
[185.00s -> 188.00s]  The silver exam.
[188.00s -> 192.00s]  I remember the most important thing is the government.
[192.00s -> 211.00s]  I am very welcome to help Chinese people.
[211.00s -> 215.00s]  So, in the meeting,
[215.00s -> 218.00s]  talking,
[218.00s -> 225.00s]  and stuff like that.
[225.00s -> 228.00s]  It's quite useful.
[228.00s -> 230.00s]  I can put it in my mind.
[230.00s -> 234.00s]  I think about it later.
[234.00s -> 242.00s]  The law might bring foreigners here.
[242.00s -> 246.00s]  I am going to take a short video today.
[246.00s -> 249.00s]  I am going to sleep early.
[249.00s -> 252.00s]  I hope tomorrow will be better.
[252.00s -> 261.00s]  I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
[261.00s -> 263.00s]  Bye.
